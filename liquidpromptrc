# Use the shorten path feature if the path is too long to fit in the prompt line.
#
# Default value is 1
#
LP_ENABLE_SHORTEN_PATH=1

# The maximum percentage of the terminal width used to display the path before removing
# the center portion of the path and replacing with LP_MARK_SHORTEN_PATH.
# LP_ENABLE_SHORTEN_PATH must be enabled to have any effect.
#
# Note:
# LP_PATH_KEEP and LP_PATH_METHOD have higher precedence over this option.
# Important path parts, including directories saved by LP_PATH_KEEP, LP_PATH_VCS_ROOT, and
# the last directory, will always be displayed, even if the path does not fit in the maximum length.
#
# Default value is 35
#
LP_PATH_LENGTH=35

# The number of directories (counting ‘/’) to display at the beginning of a shortened path.
# Set to 1, will display only root. Set to 0, will keep nothing from the beginning of the path.
# LP_ENABLE_SHORTEN_PATH must be enabled to have any effect.
#
# Default value is 2
#
LP_PATH_KEEP=2

# The number of characters to save at the start and possibly the end of a
# directory name when shortening the path.
#
# Default value is 3
#
LP_PATH_CHARACTER_KEEP=3

# Sets the method used for shortening the path display when it exceeds
# the maximum length set by LP_PATH_LENGTH.
#     truncate_chars_from_path_left:
#         Truncates characters from the start of the path,
#         showing consecutive directories as one shortened section.
#         E.g. in a directory named ~/MyProjects/Liquidprompt/tests,
#         it will be shortened to ...prompt/tests.
#         The shortened mark is LP_MARK_SHORTEN_PATH.
#     truncate_chars_from_dir_right:
#         Leaves the beginning of a directory name untouched.
#         E.g. directories will be shortened like so: ~/Doc.../Office.
#         How many characters will be untouched is set by LP_PATH_CHARACTER_KEEP.
#         The shortened mark is LP_MARK_SHORTEN_PATH.
#     truncate_chars_from_dir_middle:
#         Leaves the beginning and end of a directory name untouched.
#         E.g. in a directory named ~/MyProjects/Office,
#         then it will be shortened to ~/MyS...cts/Office.
#         How many characters will be untouched is set by LP_PATH_CHARACTER_KEEP.
#         The shortened mark is LP_MARK_SHORTEN_PATH.
#     truncate_chars_to_unique_dir:
#         Truncate each directory to the shortest unique starting portion of their name.
#         E.g. in a folder ~/dev/liquidprompt, it will be shortened to ~/d/liquidprompt
#         if there is no other directory starting with ‘d’ in the home directory.
#     truncate_to_last_dir:
#         Only display the last directory in the path.
#         In other words, the current directory name.
# All methods (other than ‘truncate_to_last_dir’) start
# at the far left of the path (limited by LP_PATH_KEEP).
# Only the minimum number of directories needed
# to fit inside LP_PATH_LENGTH will be shortened.
# LP_ENABLE_SHORTEN_PATH must be enabled to have any effect.
#
# Default value is "truncate_chars_from_path_left"
#
LP_PATH_METHOD="truncate_chars_from_path_left"

# Display the root directory of the current VCS repository with special formatting,
# set by LP_COLOR_PATH_VCS_ROOT. If LP_ENABLE_SHORTEN_PATH is enabled, also prevent
# the path shortening from shortening or hidding the VCS root directory.

# Default value is 1

#
LP_ENABLE_DETACHED_SESSIONS=1

# Check if the user has valid sudo credentials, and display an indicating mark or color.
# Will be disabled if sudo is not found.
#
# Warning:
# Each evocation of sudo by default writes to the syslog, and this will run sudo once each prompt.
# This is likely to make your sysadmin hate you.
#
# Default value is 0

#
# Default value is (i v g s)

# An array of absolute directory paths where VCS features will be disabled.
# Generally this would be used for repositories that are large and slow,
# where generating VCS information for the prompt would impact prompt responsiveness.
#
# Any subdirectory under the input directory is also disabled, so setting “/repos”
# would disable VCS display when the current directory is “/repos/a-repo”.
# Setting ("/") would disable VCS display completely.
#
# An example value would be:
# LP_DISABLED_VCS_PATHS=("/a/svn/repo" "/home/me/my/large/repo")
#
# Default value is ()
#
LP_DISABLED_VCS_PATHS=()
