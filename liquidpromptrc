# The formatting string passed to date(1) using formatting from
# strftime(3) used to display the current date and/or time.
LP_TIME_FORMAT="%H:%M:%S"

# The maximum percentage of the screen width used to display the path before
# removing the center portion of the path and replacing with '...'.
# Recommended value is 35
LP_PATH_LENGTH=35

# The number of directories (including '/') to keep at the beginning of a
# shortened path.
# Recommended value is 2
LP_PATH_KEEP=2

# The number of characters to save at the start and possibly the end of a
# directory name when shortening the path.
# Recommended value is 3
LP_PATH_CHARACTER_KEEP=3

# Sets the method used for shortening the path display when it exceeds
# the maximum length set by LP_PATH_LENGTH.
#     truncate_chars_from_path_left:
#         Truncates characters from the start of the path,
#         showing consecutive directories as one shortened section.
#         E.g. in a directory named ~/MyProjects/Liquidprompt/tests,
#         it will be shortened to ...prompt/tests.
#         The shortened mark is LP_MARK_SHORTEN_PATH.
#     truncate_chars_from_dir_right:
#         Leaves the beginning of a directory name untouched.
#         E.g. directories will be shortened like so: ~/Doc.../Office.
#         How many characters will be untouched is set by LP_PATH_CHARACTER_KEEP.
#         The shortened mark is LP_MARK_SHORTEN_PATH.
#     truncate_chars_from_dir_middle:
#         Leaves the beginning and end of a directory name untouched.
#         E.g. in a directory named ~/MyProjects/Office,
#         then it will be shortened to ~/MyS...cts/Office.
#         How many characters will be untouched is set by LP_PATH_CHARACTER_KEEP.
#         The shortened mark is LP_MARK_SHORTEN_PATH.
#     truncate_chars_to_unique_dir:
#         Truncate each directory to the shortest unique starting portion of their name.
#         E.g. in a folder ~/dev/liquidprompt, it will be shortened to ~/d/liquidprompt
#         if there is no other directory starting with ‘d’ in the home directory.
#     truncate_to_last_dir:
#         Only display the last directory in the path.
#         In other words, the current directory name.
# All methods (other than ‘truncate_to_last_dir’) start
# at the far left of the path (limited by LP_PATH_KEEP).
# Only the minimum number of directories needed
# to fit inside LP_PATH_LENGTH will be shortened.
# LP_ENABLE_SHORTEN_PATH must be enabled to have any effect.
